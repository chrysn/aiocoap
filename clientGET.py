class Agent():
    """
    Example class which performs single GET request to localhost
    port 5683 (official IANA assigned CoAP port), URI "/other/separate".
    Request is sent 2 seconds after initialization.

    Method request_resource constructs the request message to
    remote endpoint. Then it sends the message using protocol.request().
    A deferred 'd' is returned from this operation.

    Deferred 'd' is fired internally by protocol, when complete response is received.

    Method print_response is added as a callback to the deferred 'd'. This
    method's main purpose is to act upon received response (here it's simple print).
