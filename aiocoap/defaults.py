"""This module contains helpers that inspect available modules and platform
specifics to give sane values to aiocoap defaults.

All of this should eventually overridable by other libraries wrapping/using
aiocoap and by applications using aiocoap; however, these overrides do not
happen in the defaults module but where these values are actually accessed, so
this module is considered internal to aiocoap and not part of the API.

The ``_missing_modules`` functions are helpers for inspecting what is
reasonable to expect to work. They can influence default values, but should not
be used in the rest of the code for feature checking (just raise the
ImportErrors) unless it's directly user-visible ("You configured OSCORE key
material, but OSCORE needs the following unavailable modules") or in the test
suite to decide which tests to skip.
