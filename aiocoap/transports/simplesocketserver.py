"""This module implements a MessageInterface for UDP based on the asyncio
DatagramProtocol.

This is a simple version that works only for servers bound to a single unicast
address. It provides a server backend in situations when :mod:`.udp6` is
unavailable and :mod:`.simple6` needs to be used for clients.

While it is in theory capable of sending requests too, it should not be used
like that, because it won't receive ICMP errors (see below).

Shortcomings
------------

* This implementation does not receive ICMP errors. This violates the CoAP
  standard and can lead to unnecessary network traffic, bad user experience
  (when used for client requests) or even network attack amplification.

* The server can not be used with the "any-address" (``::``, ``0.0.0.0``).
  If it were allowed to bind there, it would not receive any indication from the operating system
  as to which of its own addresses a request was sent,
  and could not send the response with the appropriate sender address.

  (The :mod:`udp6<aiocoap.transports.udp6>` transport does not suffer that shortcoming,
  simplesocketserver is typically only used when that is unavailable).

  With simplesocketserver, you need to explicitly give the IP address of your server
  in the ``bind`` argument of :meth:`aiocoap.protocol.Context.create_server_context`.

* This transport is experimental and likely to change.
