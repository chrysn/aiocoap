"""This module implements a MessageInterface for UDP based on the asyncio
DatagramProtocol.

This is a simple version that works only for servers bound to a single unicast
address. It provides a server backend in situations when :mod:`.udp6` is
unavailable and :mod:`.simple6` needs to be used for clients.

While it is in theory capable of sending requests too, it should not be used
like that, because it won't receive ICMP errors (see below).

Shortcomings
------------

* This implementation does not receive ICMP errors. This violates the CoAP
    standard and can lead to unnecessary network traffic, bad user experience
    (when used for client requests) or even network attack amplification.

* This transport is experimental and likely to change.
