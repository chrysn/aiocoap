"""This module implements a MessageInterface for UDP based on the asyncio
DatagramProtocol.

This is a simple version that works only for clients (by creating a dedicated
unbound but connected socket for each communication partner) and probably not
with multicast (it is assumed to be unsafe for multicast), which can be
expected to work even on platforms where the :mod:`.udp6` module can not be
made to work (Android, OSX, Windows for missing ``recvmsg`` and socket options,
or any event loops that don't have an add_reader method).

One small but noteworthy detail about this transport is that it does not
distinguish between IP literals and host names. As a result, requests and
responses from remotes will appear to arrive from a remote whose netloc is the
requested name, not an IP literal.

This transport is experimental, likely to change, and not fully tested yet
(because the test suite is not yet ready to matrix-test the same tests with
different transport implementations, and because it still fails in proxy
blockwise tests).

    listening socket can, and can create outgoing connection-ish sockets from
    the listeing port.
