"""This module implements a MessageInterface that serves coaps:// using a
wrapped tinydtls library.

Bear in mind that the aiocoap CoAPS support is highly experimental and
incomplete.

Unlike other transports this is *not* enabled automatically in general, as it
is limited to servers bound to a single address for implementation reasons.
(Basically, because it is built on the simplesocketserver rather than the udp6
server -- that can change in future, though). Until either the implementation
is changed or binding arguments are (allowing different transports to bind to
per-transport addresses or ports), a DTLS server will only be enabled if the
AIOCOAP_DTLSSERVER_ENABLED environment variable is set, or tinydtls_server is
listed explicitly in AIOCOAP_SERVER_TRANSPORT.
"""

# Comparing this to the tinydtls transport, things are a bit easier as we don't
# expect to send the first DTLS payload (thus don't need the queue), and don't
# need that clean a cleanup (at least if we assume that the clients all shut
# down on their own anyway).
#
# Then again, keeping connections live for as long as someone holds their
# address (eg. by some "pool with N strong references, and the rest are weak"
# and just go away on overflow unless someone keeps the address alive) would be
# more convenient here.
