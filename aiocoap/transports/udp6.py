"""This module implements a MessageInterface for UDP based on a variation of
the asyncio DatagramProtocol.

This implementation strives to be correct and complete behavior while still
only using a single socket; that is, to be usable for all kinds of multicast
traffic, to support server and client behavior at the same time, and to work
correctly even when multiple IPv6 and IPv4 (using V4MAPPED style addresses)
interfaces are present, and any of the interfaces has multiple addresses.

This requires using some standardized but not necessarily widely ported
features: ``IPV6_RECVPKTINFO`` to determine
incoming packages' destination addresses (was it multicast) and to return
packages from the same address, ``IPV6_JOIN_GROUP`` for multicast
membership management and ``recvmsg`` to obtain data configured with the above
options. The need for ``AI_V4MAPPED`` and ``AI_ADDRCONFIG`` is not manifest
in the code because the latter on its own is insufficient to enable seamless
interoperability with IPv4+IPv6 servers on IPv4-only hosts; instead,
short-lived sockets are crated to assess which addresses are routable. This
should correctly deal with situations in which a client has an IPv6 ULA
assigned but no route, no matter whether the server advertises global IPv6
addresses or addresses inside that ULA. It can not deal with situations in
which the host has a default IPv6 route, but that route is not actually usable.

To the author's knowledge, there is no standardized mechanism for receiving
ICMP errors in such a setup. On Linux, ``IPV6_RECVERR`` and ``MSG_ERRQUEUE``
are used to receive ICMP errors from the socket; on other platforms, a warning
is emitted that ICMP errors are ignored. Using a :mod:`.simple6` for clients is
recommended for those when working as a client only.

Exceeding for the above error handling, no attempts are made to fall back to a
kind-of-correct or limited-functionality behavior if these options are
unavailable, for the resulting code would be hard to maintain ("``ifdef``
hell") or would cause odd bugs at users (eg. servers that stop working when an
additional IPv6 address gets assigned). If the module does not work for you,
and the options can not be added easily to your platform, consider using the
:mod:`.simple6` module instead.
