This moduel implements a TokenInterface for `CoAP over WebSockets`_.

.. _`CoAP over WebSockets`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8323#section-4

As with CoAP-over-TCP, while the transport distinguishes a connection initiator
("WebSocket (and TCP) client") and a receiver ("WebSocket (and TCP) server"),
both sides can take both roles in CoAP (ie. as a CoAP server and a CoAP
client). As the WebSocket client can not possibly be connected to (even by the
same server -- once the connection is closed, it's gone and even a new one
likely has a different port), aiocoap does not allow expressing their addresses
in URIs (given they wouldn't serve their purpose as URLs and don't provide any
stability either). Requests to a CoAP-over-WS client can be made by assigning
the remote to an outgoing request.

Port choice
-----------

Unlike the other transports, CoAP-over-WS is specified with a privileged port
(port 80) as the default port. This is impractical for aiocoap servers for two
reasons:

    * Unless explicitly configured, aiocoap is typically run as an unprivileged
      user (and has no provisions in place to receive a socket by other means
      than opening it).

    * Where a CoAP-over-WS proxy is run, there is often a "proper" website
      running on the same port on a full HTTP server. That server is usually
      capable of forwarding requests, whereas the ``websockets`` module used by
      aiocoap is in no position to either serve websites nor to proxy to an
      underlying server.

The recommended setup is therefore to run a full web server at port 80, and
configure it to proxy incoming requests for WebSockets at `/.well-known/coap`
to aiocoap's server, which defaults to binding to port 8683.

The port choice of outgoing connections, or the interpretation of the
protocol's default port (ie. the port implied by ``coap+ws://hostname/``) is of
course unaffected by this.

.. warning::

  Due to a shortcoming of aiocoap's way of specifying ports to bind
  to, if a port is explicitly stated to bind to, CoAP-over-WS will bind to that
  port plus 3000 (resulting in the abovementioned 8683 for 5683). If TLS server
  keys are given, the TLS server is launched on the next port after the HTTP
  server (typically 8684).

Using on pyodide_
-----------------

When use  on pyodide_,
instead of using the ``websockets`` module,
a simplified client-only back-end is used,
which utilizes the browser's WebSocket API.
