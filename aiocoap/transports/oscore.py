# WORK IN PROGRESS: TransportEndpoint has been renamed to MessageInterface
# here, but actually we'll be providing a RequestInterface -- that's one of the
# reasons why RequestInterface, TokenInterface and MessageInterface were split
# in the first place.

"""This module implements a RequestProvider for OSCORE. As such, it takes
routing ownership of requests that it has a security context available for, and
sends off the protected messages via another transport.

This transport is a bit different from the others because it doesn't have its
dedicated URI scheme, but purely relies on preconfigured contexts.

So far, this transport only deals with outgoing requests, and does not help in
building an OSCORE server. (Some code that could be used here in future resides
in `contrib/oscore-plugtest/plugtest-server` as the `ProtectedSite` class.

In outgoing request, this transport automatically handles Echo options that
appear to come from RFC8613 Appendix B.1.2 style servers. They indicate that
the server could not process the request initially, but could do so if the
client retransmits it with an appropriate Echo value.
