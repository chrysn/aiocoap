"""This module implements a MessageInterface that handles coaps:// using a
wrapped tinydtls library.

This currently only implements the client side. To have a test server, run::

    $ git clone https://github.com/obgm/libcoap.git --recursive
    $ cd libcoap
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --with-tinydtls --disable-shared
    $ make
    $ ./examples/coap-server -k secretPSK

(Using TinyDTLS in libcoap is important; with the default OpenSSL build, I've
seen DTLS1.0 responses to DTLS1.3 requests, which are hard to debug.)

The test server with its built-in credentials can then be accessed using::

    $ echo '{"coaps://localhost/*": {"dtls": {"psk": {"ascii": "secretPSK"}, "client-identity": {"ascii": "client_Identity"}}}}' > testserver.json
    $ ./aiocoap-client coaps://localhost --credentials testserver.json

While it is planned to allow more programmatical construction of the
credentials store, the currently recommended way of storing DTLS credentials is
to load a structured data object into the client_credentials store of the context:

>>> c = await aiocoap.Context.create_client_context()          # doctest: +SKIP
>>> c.client_credentials.load_from_dict(
...     {'coaps://localhost/*': {'dtls': {
...         'psk': b'secretPSK',
...         'client-identity': b'client_Identity',
...         }}})                                               # doctest: +SKIP

where, compared to the JSON example above, byte strings can be used directly
rather than expressing them as 'ascii'/'hex' (`{'hex': '30383135'}` style works
as well) to work around JSON's limitation of not having raw binary strings.

Bear in mind that the aiocoap CoAPS support is highly experimental; for
example, while requests to this server do complete, error messages are still
shown during client shutdown.
