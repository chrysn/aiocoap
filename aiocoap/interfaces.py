    message type and message ID, and are driven by a Context that deals with
    retransmission.

    Usually, an MessageInterface refers to something like a local socket, and
    send messages to different remote endpoints depending on the message's
    addresses. Just as well, a MessageInterface can be useful for one single
    address only, or use various local addresses depending on the remote

class EndpointAddress(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """An address that is suitable for routing through the application to a
    remote endpoint.

    Depending on the MessageInterface implementation used, an EndpointAddress
    property of a message can mean the message is exchanged "with
    [2001:db8::2:1]:5683, while my local address was [2001:db8:1::1]:5683"
    (typical of UDP6), "over the connected <Socket at
    0x1234>, whereever that's connected to" (simple6 or TCP) or "with
    participant 0x01 of the OSCAP key 0x..., routed over <another
    EndpointAddress>".

    EndpointAddresses are only concstructed by MessageInterface objects,
    either for incoming messages or when populating a message's .remote in
    :meth:`MessageInterface.determine_remote`.

    There is no requirement that those address are always identical for a given
    address. However, incoming addresses must be hashable and hash-compare
    identically to requests from the same context. The "same context", for the
    purpose of EndpointAddresses, means that the message must be eligible for
    request/response, blockwise (de)composition and observations. (For example,
    in a DTLS context, the hash must change between epochs due to RFC7252
    Section 9.1.2).

    So far, it is required that hash-identical objects also compare the same.
    That requirement might go away in future to allow equality to reflect finer
    details that are not hashed. (The only property that is currently known not
    to be hashed is the local address in UDP6, because that is *unknown* in
    initially sent packages, and thus disregarded for comparison but needed to
    round-trip through responses.)
