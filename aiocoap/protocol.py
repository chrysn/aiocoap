"""This module contains the classes that are responsible for keeping track of messages:

* :class:`Context` roughly represents the CoAP endpoint (basically a UDP
  socket) -- something that can send requests and possibly can answer incoming
  requests.
* a :class:`Request` gets generated whenever a request gets sent to keep
  track of the response
* a :class:`Responder` keeps track of a single incoming request

class Context(asyncio.DatagramProtocol, interfaces.RequestProvider):
    """An object that passes messages between an application and the network

    A :class:`.Context` gets bound to a network interface as an asyncio
    protocol. It manages the basic CoAP network mechanisms like message
    deduplication and retransmissions, and delegates management of blockwise
    transfer as well as the details of matching requests with responses to the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Responder` classes.

    In that respect, a Context (as currently implemented) is also an endpoint.
    It is anticipated, though, that issues arise due to which the
    implementation won't get away with creating a single socket, and that it
    will be required to deal with multiple endpoints. (E.g. the V6ONLY=0 option
    is not portable to some OS, and implementations might need to bind to
    different ports on different interfaces in multicast contexts). When those
    distinctions will be implemented, message dispatch will stay with the
    context, which will then deal with the individual endpoints.

    In a way, a :class:`.Context` is the single object all CoAP messages that
    get treated by a single application pass by.

    Context creation
    ----------------

    Instead of passing a protocol factory to the asyncio loop's
    create_datagram_endpoint method, the following convenience functions are
    recommended for creating a context:

    .. automethod:: create_client_context
    .. automethod:: create_server_context

    If you choose to create the context manually, make sure to wait for its
    :attr:`ready` future to complete, as only then can messages be sent.

    Dispatching messages
    --------------------

    A context's public API consists of the :meth:`send_message` function,
    the :attr:`outgoing_requests`, :attr:`incoming_requests` and
    :attr:`outgoing_obvservations` dictionaries, and the :attr:`serversite`
    object, but those are not stabilized yet, and for most applications the
    following convenience functions are more suitable:

    .. automethod:: request

    .. automethod:: multicast_request

    If more control is needed, eg. with observations, create a
    :class:`Request` yourself and pass the context to it.
