class AsyncCLIDaemon:
    """Helper for creating daemon-style CLI prorgrams.

    Note that this currently doesn't create a Daemon in the sense of doing a
    daemon-fork; that could be added on demand, though.

    Subclass this and implement the :meth:`start` method as an async
    function; it will be passed all the constructor's arguments.

    When all setup is complete and the program is operational, return from the
    start method.

    Implement the :meth:`shutdown` coroutine and to do cleanup; what actually
    runs your program will, if possible, call that and await its return.

    Two usage patterns for this are supported:

    * Outside of an async context, run run ``MyClass.sync_main()``, typically
      in the program's ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` section.

      In this mode, the loop that is started is configured to safely shut down
      the loop when SIGINT is received.

    * To run a subclass of this in an existing loop, start it with
      ``MyClass(...)`` (possibly passing in the loop to run it on if not already
      in an async context), and then awaiting its ``.initializing`` future. To
      stop it, await its ``.shutdown()`` method.

      Note that with this usage pattern, the :meth:`.stop()` method has no
      effect; servers that ``.stop()`` themselves need to signal their desire
      to be shut down through other channels (but that is an atypical case).
