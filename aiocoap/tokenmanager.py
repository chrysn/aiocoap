class PlumbingRequest:
    """Low-level meeting point between a request and a any responses that come
    back on it.

    A single request message is placed in the PlumbingRequest at creation time.
    Any responses, as well as any exception happening in the course of
    processing, are passed back to the requester along the PlumbingRequest. A
    response can carry an indication of whether it is final; an exception
    always is.

    This object is used both on the client side (where the Context on behalf of
    the application creates a PlumbingRequest and passes it to the network
    transports that send the request and fill in any responses) and on the
    server side (where the Context creates one for an incoming request and
    eventually lets the server implementation populate it with responses).

    This currently follows a callback dispatch style. (It may be developed into
    something where only awaiting a response drives the proces, though).

    Currently, the requester sets up the object, connects callbacks, and then
    passes the PlumbingRequest on to whatever creates the response.

    The creator of responses is notified by the PlumbingRequest of a loss of
    interest in a response when there are no more callback handlers registered
    by registering an on_interest_end callback. As the response callbacks need
    to be already in place when the PlumbingRequest is passed on to the
    responder, the absence event callbacks is signalled by callign the callback
    immediately on registration.

    To accurately model "loss of interest", it is important to use the
    two-phase setup of first registering actual callbacks and then producing
    events and/or placing on_interest_end callbacks; this is not clearly
    expressed in type or state yet. (One possibility would be for the
    PlumbingRequest to carry a preparation boolean, and which prohibits event
    sending during preparation and is_interest=True callback creation
    afterwards)."""
