"""This module describes how security credentials are expressed in aiocoap,
how security protocols (TLS, DTLS, OSCOAP) can store and access their key
material, and for which URIs they are used.

For consistency, mappings between accessible resources and their credentials
are always centered around URIs. This is slightly atypical, because a client
will typically use a particular set of credentials for all operations on one
server, while a server first loads all available credentials and then filters
out whether the client may actually access a resource per-path, but it works
with full URIs (or patterns thereof) just as well. That approach allows using
more similar structures both on the server and the client, and works smoothly
for virtual hosting, firewalling and clients accessing resources with varying
credentials.

Still, client and server credentials are kept apart, lest a server open up (and
potentially reveal) to a PSK set it is only configured to use as a client.
While client credentials already have their place in
:attr:`aiocoap.protocol.Context.client_credentials`, server credentials are not
in use at a standardized location yet because there is only code in the OSCORE
plug tests that can use it so far.

Library developer notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This whole module currently relies on a mixture of introspection and manual
parsing of the JSON-ish tree. A preferred expression of the same would rely on
the credentials.cddl description and build an object tree from that, but the
author is unaware of any existing CDDL Python implementation. That might also
ease porting to platforms that don't support inspect like micropython does.

server can of course just say it doesn't want to have the Site handle it and
just say '*': { 'unprotected': true }, add some ':foo': {'dtls-psk': ...}
entries (so communication can be established in the first place) and let
individual resources decide whether they return 4.01 or something else.

client can be the same with different implied role, or have something like

client: {
            'coap://myothersite/*': ':myotherkey',
            ...
        }

in future also

server: {
        'coaps://mysite/*': { 'dtls-cert': {'key': '...pem', 'cert': '...crt'} }
        }

client: {
        '*': { 'dtls-cert': { 'ca': '/etc/ssl/...' } }
}

or more complex ones:

server: {
        'coaps://myothersite/wellprotected': { 'all': [ ':mydtls', ':myotherkey' ]}
        'coaps://myothersite/*': { 'any': [ ':mydtls', ':myotherkey' ]}
