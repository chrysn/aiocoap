"""Basic resource implementations

A resource in URL / CoAP / REST terminology is the thing identified by a URI.

Here, a :class:`.Resource` is the place where server functionality is
implemented. In many cases, there exists one persistent Resource object for a
given resource (eg. a ``TimeResource()`` is responsible for serving the
``/time`` location). On the other hand, an aiocoap server context accepts only
one thing as its serversite, and that is a Resource too (typically of the
:class:`Site` class).

Resources are most easily implemented by deriving from :class:`.Resource` and
implementing ``render_get``, ``render_post`` and similar coroutine methods.
Those take a single request message object and must return a
:class:`aiocoap.Message` object.

To serve more than one resource on a site, use the :class:`Site` class to
dispatch requests based on the Uri-Path header.

    Run this on your request and response before returning from do_GET; it is
    safe to use this function with all kinds of responses, it will only act on
    2.05 Content. The hash used are the first 8 bytes of the sha1 sum of the
    payload.

    Note that this method is not ideal from a server performance point of view
    (a file server, for example, might want to hash only the stat() result of a
    file instead of reading it in full), but it saves bandwith for the simple
    cases.
