index hack
==========

in order to have a readme that is usable for simple ReST builders like github,
the readme now contains hardwired links to readthedocs or local files.
sphinx (and thus readthedocs) sees, via the aiocoap_index.py sphinx extension,
a preprocessed version where all the static links to readthedocs are replaced
with sphinx-internal directives and properly resolved in the locally built
docs.

per-module documentation hack
=============================

pages similar to sphinx-apidoc's output are built by the sphinx module
aiocoap_index.py in the doc/module/ directory. sphinx-apidoc is not used here
because it would need to be invoked outside of sphinx (which is not practical
with tools like readthedocs), and because some customization is done (eg. for
aiocoap.numbers).


for both hacks, suggestions for cleaner solutions that keep the git tree free
of generated files are appreciated.

man pages
=========

html is the default output format, but man pages can also be generated:

    $ python3 -m sphinx -b man doc/ build/sphinx/man
