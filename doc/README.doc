index hack
==========

in order to have a readme that is usable for simple ReST builders like github,
the readme now contains hardwired links to readthedocs or local files.
sphinx (and thus readthedocs) sees, via the aiocoap_index.py sphinx extension,
a preprocessed version where all the static links to readthedocs are replaced
with sphinx-internal directives and properly resolved in the locally built
docs.

per-module documentation hack
=============================

pages similar to sphinx-apidoc's output are built by the sphinx module
aiocoap_index.py in the doc/module/ directory. sphinx-apidoc is not used here
because it would need to be invoked outside of sphinx (which is not practical
with tools like readthedocs), and because some customization is done (eg. for
aiocoap.numbers).


for both hacks, suggestions for cleaner solutions that keep the git tree free
of generated files are appreciated.

dependency hack
===============

readthedocs allows running an install of the python package, but does not allow
specifying which extras are required to build the documentation. thus, setup.py
injects an additional dependency (that's otherwise an extra of the docs
category) when building in a READTHEDOCS environment is detected.

man pages
=========

the build_sphinx command sphinx hooks into distutils is only capable of
building one output format (and html is a sane default). if you want man pages,
run the following:

    $ python3 -m sphinx -b man doc/ build/sphinx/man
